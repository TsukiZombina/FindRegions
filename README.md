# FindRegions
Let S be a set of n disjoint line segments whose upper endpoints lie on theline y = 1 and whose lower endpoints lie on the line y = 0. 
These segmentspartition the horizontal strip[−∞:∞]×[0 : 1]into n + 1 regions.  Give an O(nlogn) time algorithm to build a binary search tree on the segments in S such that the region containing a query point can be determined in O(logn)time. 
Also describe the query algorithm in detail.
